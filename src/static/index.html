      <section id="About Myself">
        <h2>About Myself</h2>
        <p>My interest has always been pulled by electronics and computers, with my curiosity pointing toward learning how they work and can be managed. 
      <br>I take pride in where I work and try to be as flexible and cooperative as possible to my abilities. </p>
		<h2>Personal Hobbies/Achievements</h2>
		<p>My hobbies include keeping up with the latest developments in computer hardware and dismantling and reassembling electronics in hopes of gaining a better understanding of how they work and come together as a whole.

      <BR><BR>My current position (At the time of writing this) At Star Leisure Casino and Arcade has helped me with this
      <BR> due to my role of helping with the machine hardware such as motors and cables,
      <BR> with even times helping the on-site mechanics with more advanced repairs.
      
      <BR><BR>A personal achievement of mine was being selected to code into the Fionn Supercomputer from Dunsink observatory after being chosen by my coder dojo at the age of 10.

		<p>
      
      While progressing through my course, I have been learning the following programming languages.
      <BR><BR>C, Java, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and BashScript
      
      <BR><BR>Other Technical skills I have improved are knowledge of using breadboards to manually configure inputs for arm-based CPUs on a breadboard and the assembly and dual boot installation of Windows and Linux on PCs and Raspberry Pi.
      
      <BR><BR>Deployment of Linux-based virtual machines through Azure, Google Cloud for virtual command terminals, and a virtual deployment of Ubuntu through Virtual Box.
      
      <BR><BR>Regarding web development, I enjoy the backend parts, including the internal logic of what links should do in contrast to how the web page looks. 
      
      </p>
		
		<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
		<p>A Java-based machine learning prediction program that reads an Excel spreadsheet containing data of hypothetical data in which it will determine based on the given data set if a user who inputs their own data applies to a certain role.
      <BR><BR>Now I`m trying to develop a Java program that will be given a directory of my pc to search for any file with a timestamp within the name and remove all instances of it, including any subdirectories it finds. 
      <BR><BR>RobotC-based robots made with Lego models that are designed to travel on an X Y Coordinate grid of a set distance
